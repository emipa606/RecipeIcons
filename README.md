# 1.1 ABOUT

For 1.1, this mod adds:

- tooltips with recipe information
- icons in thing filters
- icons for some surgery icons
- support for complex items with Cutout shader. See the picture for reference. Note: boxes for body parts are from my other mod, [Bionic icons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1677616980).

# 1.0 ABOUT

Adds icons for various menus in the game, including "Add Bill". Supports other mods out of the box.

Clicking on the icon will show information dialog for related item (previously, you'd click on the (i) icon for that).

Safe to add and remove from save games.
